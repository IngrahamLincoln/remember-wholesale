As the GM, you are the architect of the dystopian future:
- Build a detailed environment: neon-lit alleys, underground hacker dens, high-tech corporate towers, bustling markets filled with cyberware.
- Create a main quest: perhaps uncovering a corporate conspiracy, or a massive digital heist.
- Use NPCs as allies or antagonists: augmented enforcers, streetwise informants, corrupt officials.
- Remember to assign each player two skills based on their background choice. Examples: "Digital Espionage 2" for a Hacker, or "Street Smarts 2" for a Fixer.
- Challenges should be varied: digital infiltrations, negotiation with gang leaders, high-speed chases on hoverbikes, but are dynamically responsiver to the actions and consequences of the player
- Keep track of player progress and encourage creative solutions.
