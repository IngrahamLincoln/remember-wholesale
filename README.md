# remember-wholesale

I'm reminded of the short story We Can Remember It for You Wholesale by Phillip K. Dick.  

The goal for this project is a dialogue environment between a user and an agent. A second agent will oversee the conversation and periodically make summaries in order to store those summaries in a vector database. This agent, or combination of agents will also search this database when it is appropriate to refer to past conversations. The goal is to begin building a memory in order to add some nuance and complexity to an agents interactions. 



Possible applications:

Spinning up memories for an NPC
Personal assistant with temporal permenency.
Vectorizing an entire syllabus or textbook in order to maximize learning for specific courses. 



## Things I need to learn more about:

- data gathering/preparation
- Embeddings
- Vector databases
- Langchain
- SQl
- Semantic search
- Open source LLMs

- Other Relavent python packages and libraries.

## Intended outcomes.

- familiarity with vector databases, langchain, system prompting. 
- More intuition regarding databases, API calls, chain engineering, etc.


## Tentative plan. 
Week 1 Oct 22 - 28

- Be a sponge. Youtube videos, READMEs, podcasts, blogs, repositories. dive in and familiarize myself with what is out there and what is being done with it. 
- I'll try to document what are the most relavent sources of data. 
- Pseudocode draft

Week 2 Oct 29 - Nov 4th

- Meet with Magda on 31st - discuss her workflow, and code. Ask questions, etc. 
- Begin writing code - aim for MVP

At this point I'll be more knowledgable, I will update this plan with where I'd like the project to take me.
