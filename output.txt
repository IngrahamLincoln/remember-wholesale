Appearance: Max is a cyber-enhanced individual of average height and wiry build, with a pair of piercing electric blue eyes, courtesy of his ocular implants. He sports shaved hair on the sides with a chaos of curls on top that compliments his light brown skin. Max has several noticeable cybernetic enhancements, including a reinforced prosthetic arm, capable of interacting with virtual interfaces, inscribed with pulsing neon data streams. His style is a mix of grunge and neo-futurism: black leather jacket with high-tech patches, faded jeans, military-grade boots, and a tattered t-shirt displaying an old anarcho-punk band he's fond of.

Background Skills: Max's background skills include "Digital Manipulation 2" and "Techie Aptitude 2". Growing up in the slums of this high-tech city, Max had to learn how to twist the digital world to his advantage. This not only meant hacking security systems for sustenance but also manipulating digital information to protect himself from the prying eyes of the megacorps. Additionally, his fascination with tech, matched with his resourcefulness, led him to become proficient in scavenging, repurposing, and repairing gadgets – an indispensable survival strategy in the jagged urban jungle. The cyberdeck he carries was built from scavenged parts and is a testament to his technical acumen. Please roll a D6 for the action you are interested in performing now, Wildcard.
